# productivity-timer
A basic productivity timer that will track the time spent on projects.


To be added:

Further bug hunting

Functionality to save logs on reset as log1.yml log2.yml etc

Ability to close the app while time is being tracked and reopen the app to stop timing

Maybe - Autoreset each week
