# productivity-timer
A basic productivity timer that will track the time spent on projects.


To be added:

Further bug hunting

Functionality to save logs on reset as log1.yml log2.yml etc. -- Done!

Time breakdown analysis (Percents, Bar graphs)

Maybe - Ability to close the app while time is being tracked and reopen the app to stop timing 

Maybe - Autoreset each week
